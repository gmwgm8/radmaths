What radioactive calculation tool is not readily found online

I'd be happy to help you find information about radioactive calculation tools that might be less commonly available online. Let me search for what specialized tools exist and which ones are harder to access.

Based on my research, several types of radioactive calculation tools are not readily found online or have restricted access:

Commercial/Proprietary Software
MicroShield and other Grove Software products like MicroSkyshine and RadDecay are commercial tools that require purchase 
Radiationsoftware
Radiationsoftware
. These perform gamma radiation shielding calculations and radioactive decay analysis but aren't freely available as web-based calculators.

FASTRAD and RayXpert are specialized commercial software packages for space radiation analysis and nuclear/medical dose calculations using Monte Carlo methods 
FASTRAD Software
RayXpert
. These are professional-grade tools requiring licensing.

Specialized Government Tools
DCAL (Dose and Risk Calculation software) is downloadable from EPA/ORNL but is intended for experienced users with knowledge of computational dosimetry 
US EPA
US EPA
 - it's not a simple online calculator. While technically available, it requires significant expertise to use properly.

True coincidence correction calculators for gamma ray spectrometry are specialized utilities that exist primarily in technical documents and aren't commonly available as standalone online tools 
IAEA-TECDOC-1275 Specialized software utilities for gamma ray spectrometry
.

What's Missing Online
The tools most difficult to find as simple web calculators include:

Neutron activation analysis calculators
Complex multi-nuclide decay chain calculators with daughter product buildup
Site-specific dose assessment tools for environmental releases
Advanced Monte Carlo radiation transport calculators
While basic decay calculations and simple dose conversions are readily available online (like Rad Pro Calculator), the more sophisticated analysis tools typically require downloading specialized software or purchasing commercial packages.

Okay I want to build a website that does what RadProCalculator does but better and that also looks way better. I want the formatting to look similar to my first website www.gsunitconversion.com

I wasn't able to access your gsunitconversion.com site directly. Could you describe the design aesthetic you're going for, or share a screenshot? In the meantime, let me check out RadProCalculator to understand what calculations we need to implement:

favicon

Fetched Rad Pro Calculator: Online Nuclear Calculations and Free Health Physics Software

The page didn't load with much content. Let me search for more details about what RadProCalculator offers:

Great! Now I have a good understanding of what RadProCalculator does. Based on the search results, it includes:

Radioactive decay calculations (half-life, decay over time)
Gamma dose rate calculations (activity to dose rate, dose rate to activity)
Shielding calculations (dose with various materials like lead, concrete, steel)
Unit conversions (Bq, Ci, Sv, rem, etc.)
Beta dose rate calculations
Since I can't see your gsunitconversion.com site, could you describe its design? Or I can create a modern, clean design with these features:

Design suggestions:

Clean, modern interface with smooth gradients or solid colors
Card-based layout for different calculators
Responsive design that works on mobile
Clear input/output sections
Professional color scheme (blues, teals, or your preference)
Easy navigation between different calculation types
Would you like me to:

Start with a specific calculator (like decay or dose rate)?
Create the full landing page with all calculator options?
Or tell me more about your gsunitconversion.com design so I can match that style?
What would you prefer, and what color scheme/design aesthetic are you going for?

gsunitconversion screenshot.png
Perfect! I can see your design aesthetic now - beautiful landscape background with a clean, centered card interface. Let me create a Radiation Calculator website with a similar look but tailored for nuclear calculations.
